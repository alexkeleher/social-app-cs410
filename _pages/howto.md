This website is built using Jekyll with the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) (MM)

You can find the Jekyll quickstart and docs [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). 

Install the prerequisites, install Jekyll and bundler, then you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` to generate the site and run it locally. Livereload also lets you see your changes live.

The docs aren't the best but if you root around you can figure it out. Feel free to switch to an easier method of making a site, like a static HTML site or one of the easier pre-installed github themes, if this feels too daunting. All the pages are `md` files so they're pretty easy to transfer.
## Pages

The home page is found at [`index.md`](../index.md), while other pages are found in [`pages`](./) and [`presentations`](../_presentations/). You can make more folders to sort content as well. Note that the footer and header are autogenerated. The page files only control the main body of content.

Every page has **front matter**, which is a section at the top which tells Jekyll how to generate it.

```yml
---
permalink: /about/  <!-- the link to the page -->
title: "The Team"   <!-- page title -->
layout: single      <!-- the layout from MM to use, usually you just want single -->
classes: wide       <!-- any additional modifiers from MM, keep every page wide -->
---
```

Some layouts will have more front matter options, and you'll have to look at the MM docs for that info based on the layout

Pages are written in `markdown` but you can also add in some `HTML` to have better control over how elements are laid out or styled. You can also use Jekyll's Liquid syntax to use variables or do logic. An example of this is in [`about.md`](./about.md) 
{% raw %}

```html
{% for member in site.data.members %}
    <div class="bio">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ member.photo }}">
        <div class="name"> {{ member.name }} </div>
        <p class="desc"> {{ member.bio }} </p>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

Here, I use the data stored in the [`_data/members.yml`](../_data/members.yml) to generate the entire list of members and their photos without having to copypaste. Try removing my entry from the data file entirely and see how the page updates. You can make more yml data files and reference them throughout the site. Read more about this [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/).

After you're done making the page, you can freely link to it from another page using the permalink. The base URL of the website is `/social-app-cs410/` or you can call it using `{{ site.baseurl }}`. If you want to add a page to the navigation in the header, you can add it to [`navigation.yml`](../_data/navigation.yml) with a title and URL.

## Layouts and Includes
MM has a *bunch* of layout files and inclusion files that are used as defaults in the pages. If you find a layout you want to use on the docs and want to see how its structured, you can look at the [layouts](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/_layouts) or the [includes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/_includes) on the MM GitHub repository. 

Something you can do is **overwrite** any of these includes files. This is done by adding a file in the [`_includes`](../_includes/) directory. For example, I wanted to add the ODU links to the footer. I did this by copy and pasting the footer include from the MM repo into the `./_includes/footer.html` file, then editing it to add the two links.  I also essentially deleted the `post_pagination.html` include by creating a new empty file with the same name.

You can do the same things with any of the page includes if you want to customize them.

## CSS

Obviously you'll have to style things on the site. To do this, you can either in-line the styles inside HTML tags or you can add CSS to the [`main.scss`](../assets/css/main.scss) file. MM uses the Sass preprocessor, which is basically a fancy way to handle CSS files. You can just write standard CSS, or if you want to take advantage of more features you can find them [here, at the Sass guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide/).

If you want to edit a part of the page that was generated automatically, you can open the developer tools to try and find the `class` or `id` of the HTML element. Then use this with CSS selectors to style the element, e.g., editing the width of elements like I did here:
```css
article.page,
div.archive {
    float: left;
    width: 100%;
}
```

## The Config File

You don't *really* need to touch the config file very much (unless you find something to change). The only useful parts are at the bottom - the default page layouts and the collections.

The default page settings just let you, as the name suggests, set default front matter settings for certain pages to follow. For example, all the pages in the `_presentations/` folder are single layout, have the author profile off, and don't have share buttons. These are all related to the front matter from earlier, so check the MM docs.

You can also set up collections, which lets you group pages together, e.g., the presentations collection:
```yml
collections:
  presentations:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:name/
```

which is then used by the [`presentations.md`](./presentations.md) to automatically generate a listing of all the presentations via the MM collection layout. Learn more [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).

## The End

This is on the gh-pages branch of the repo. GitHub will automatically do all the generating when you push, so all you need to do it edit, commit, and push. Remember that you can view your changes locally with the `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` command, so you don't need to push to see what your updates would do. 

You can also play around in the generated `_site` folder if you want to see how the stuff out here translates to the website.

I think I covered everything here. Feel free to dm me with any questions and I'd be happy to explain. Try to use the docs and the MM repo to guide you. Google can also be your best friend `:D`
